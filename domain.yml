  - text: "The Decepticons are new to earth and hence they do not remember any paths yet. 
    So  they use a very trivial technique to map the locations that they visit very often. Autobots just got you
    the information on their technique and now need your help in a very special mission. Decepticons draw 
    a maze of a straight black line and at the end of this maze they have all their major weapons facilities
    located,  so if someone keeps following the straight line and solves the maze then they can get to the
     Decepticons' weapons facilities. There is also debris in the path of lines. Your job is to build a 
     bot that can follow a straight line and reach the endpoint without deviating from the line or colliding 
     with any debris on the walls. Occasionally, the bot may need to follow the debris if it obstructs the line. 
     Can you pull off this task?

    BOT SPECIFICATION:-
      The bot must contain sufficient sensors to detect black lines and follow the wall.
      The bot must fit into a box of dimensions 25 cm x20 cm x20 cm.
      You are allowed to use readymade sensors. 
      You can’t supply more than 120W power to your robot.
      Each team is allowed to have only one autonomous bot.
      The bot should not communicate with any other devices.
      Data transfer violations will lead to disqualification.
      During the run, the autonomous bot must not damage the arena. 
      The robots can use on-board or off-board power supplies. 

    AREA SPECIFICATION:-
      Black lines of width 3cm on white background. 
      The maze may consist of dead ends. 
      There are two rectangles: 
              The first rectangle marks the start point of stage 1. 
              The second rectangle marks the end of stage 1.
      There will only be left, or right (90-degree) turns. 
          For Stage 1, there may be left, or right turns, dead ends, + crossings, and curved paths in the maze.
          For Stage 2, your bot should follow a wall on its right side (refer sample arena). 


    GAMEPLAY:-

      All the teams have to submit their robot for design testing.
      Your robot has to traverse the whole arena from start to end. 
      There are multiple checkpoints in the whole arena. 
      After clearing any checkpoint, if any timeout is required,
      the robot has to restart the last visited checkpoint. The maximum number of attempts is 3.

    EVENT FORMAT:-
    Bot Review & Preliminary Round: 
                Bot Review & Preliminary Round: The event coordinators would review the bots built to
                gauge the progress. The bot should be able to complete the first part of the arena. 

    Final Round: -
              Bots selected for the final round should be able to complete the whole arena.
    COMPONENTS: - 
    RULES AND REGULATIONS

      team can’t have members from different colleges.
      A team can have a maximum of 4 members and a minimum of 2 members.
      Judges’ decisions will be final and binding to all. 
      You will be provided with 220V 50 HZ AC supply.
